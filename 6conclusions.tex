\begin{itemize}
	\item built a NN probabilistic nowcasting model
	\item Did we answer research questions?
	\item What was the answer? 
	\item Tested skill of model against baselines
	\item OK deterministic skill (but not good enough)
	\item Lackluster probabilistic skill -> lack of sample diversity 
	\item silverline: makes pretty pictures and is fast, shows it is possible to combine DL for nonlinearity + probabilistic modeling
	\item Many possible reasons left undiscovered for problems
	\item much potential  for improvement
	\item model not yet useful for forecasters
\end{itemize}
