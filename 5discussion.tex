\section{What could we learn from uncertainty}

Decomposition of predictive uncertainty into aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties is not performed, as it was deemed out of scope for this work. Indeed, trying to model the uncertainty the radar image inputs is a separate problem which is not so much of interest in the domain of radar-based precipitation, as so much more can be done to improve performance by ameliorating radar scan fidelity, preprocessing, and choice. Despite of this, one could still view aleatoric uncertainty as a proxy to non-predictability of precipitation given starting conditions represented by the input frames. This could in the case of the iterative models presented at least serve as a metric to quantify the uncertainty created by feeding back in previous model outputs and could potentially allow the compound aleatoric and epistemic ensemble spread to better match the true distribution of the data.
