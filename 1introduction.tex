Nowcasting is defined as weather forecasting at very short timescales, from minutes ahead up to several hours. The ability to provide an accurate precipitation nowcast has grown during this century into a meteorologically and societally significant challenge. This significance emanates from the fact that early warnings of severe precipitation enable authorities and other actors to make early decisions enabling for example disaster damage control, traffic safety, flash flood prevention, and mitigation of economic loss incurred by sudden and heavy precipitation. High-density urbanization has exacerbated these issues, making it evermore vital to discover reliable and skillful methods for precipitation nowcasting. 

Numerical weather prediction (NWP) solves the partial differential equations governing the physical processes of weather and climate to produce forecasts. However, such method is not applicable to predicting at timescales as short as 0 to 6 hours. This is mainly due to imperfect initialization making simulations unable to reach numerical stability in such short time timescales. Other problems with NWP include their computational expensiveness and the low spatial resolution of large-scale NWP, making those systems unfit to predict for example heavy localized rainfall.

To compensate for the shortcomings of NWP in the realm of precipitation nowcasting, many different dedicated models and algorithms have been developed. Many of those systems are based on the estimation of the precipitation advection field from radar echo image sequences and the further extrapolation of these sequences along the advection field. Other methods have been developed that track and try to nowcast the evolution of individual rain cells, instead of the whole field. Dedicated nowcasting methods have had great success in forecasting the immediate future, but their performance typically degrades quickly, becoming unreliable often in the range of an hour. This is related to the fact that basic extrapolation-based methods have limitations such as failing to capture nonlinear patterns like convective initiation and life-cycles. A lot of work has been done in nowcasting in trying to incorporate modeling of higher-order and multiscale phenomena into advection-extrapolation based models. Recently, Deep-learning (DL) based precipitation nowcasting approaches have started showing promising results delving into the issues of traditional methods thanks to the high volume of training data available, their expressive power and the relative cheapness of inference. 


\section{Problem statement}


While the above introduction has cast the problem of nowcasting as finding a single optimal point estimate for future precipitation, it is useful to think about it in a probabilistic way. Because in nowcasting the phenomena we are most interested in are extreme events, and these are the events that we want to prepare for, it makes intuitive sense that accurate and reliable probabilistic nowcasts are primordial for operational decision-making in meteorological crises.

Indeed, the interest in probabilistic nowcasts has grown lately and many new probabilistic models have been introduced in the last decades, notably the Short-Term Ensemble Prediction System (STEPS) \cite{bowler_steps_2006} and more recently the Lagrangian Integro-Difference equation model with Autoregression (LINDA) \cite{pulkkinen_lagrangian_2021}. These methods predict ensembles, that are used to estimate underlying distributions of data and precipitation probabilities. They perform reasonably well, but have computationally expensive inference and suffer from the same limitations other advection-extrapolation based methods. 

So far, only little work has been done on using DL to produce probabilistic precipitation nowcasts, with the biggest breaktrough perhaps being Ravuri et al. \cite{ravuri_skilful_2021} using adversarially trained deep generative models to produce ensemble nowcasts. There exists many possible ways of making probabilistic nowcasts using deep learning, with most of them focusing on directly modeling probability distributions of data. Another approach, that we will focus on from now on is instead to model the uncertainty of model parameters rather than that of the data. This is done by using Bayesian Neural Networks and has an advantage of providing implicit regularization of model parameters thus reducing overfitting, while outputting an ensemble of predictions whose variability in part reflects network parameter uncertainty given the training data. Bayesian neural networks have been proposed for use in other risk-averse application such as biomedical image segmention \cite{kwon_uncertainty_2020} and autonomous vehicles \cite{mcallister_concrete_2017}. 

In this work, we will approach the problem of making skillful and reliable probabilistic precipitation nowcasts by building an uncertainty-aware Bayesian Neural Networks. A baseline Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) will be turned into a Bayesian Convolutional Network (BCN) with optimization performed using stochastic variational inference (SVI) over model parameters. The model is trained, validated and tested using Finnish Meteorological Institute (FMI) radar reflectivity composites. For verification, both deterministic and probabilistic metrics are calculated in order to assess prediction skill against other probabilistic models and deterministic counterparts.
