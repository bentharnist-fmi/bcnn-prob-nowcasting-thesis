	abstract = {Artificial Neural Networks are connectionist systems that perform a given task by learning on examples without having prior knowledge about the task. This is done by finding an optimal point estimate for the weights in every node. Generally, the network using point estimates as weights perform well with large datasets, but they fail to express uncertainty in regions with little or no data, leading to overconfident decisions. In this paper, Bayesian Convolutional Neural Network (BayesCNN) using Variational Inference is proposed, that introduces probability distribution over the weights. Furthermore, the proposed BayesCNN architecture is applied to tasks like Image Classification, Image Super-Resolution and Generative Adversarial Networks. The results are compared to point-estimates based architectures on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets for Image CLassification task, on BSD300 dataset for Image Super Resolution task and on CIFAR10 dataset again for Generative Adversarial Network task. BayesCNN is based on Bayes by Backprop which derives a variational approximation to the true posterior. We, therefore, introduce the idea of applying two convolutional operations, one for the mean and one for the variance. Our proposed method not only achieves performances equivalent to frequentist inference in identical architectures but also incorporate a measurement for uncertainties and regularisation. It further eliminates the use of dropout in the model. Moreover, we predict how certain the model prediction is based on the epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties and empirically show how the uncertainty can decrease, allowing the decisions made by the network to become more deterministic as the training accuracy increases. Finally, we propose ways to prune the Bayesian architecture and to make it more computational and time effective.},

	title = {{RainNet} v1.0: a convolutional neural network for radar-based precipitation nowcasting},
	abstract = {In this study, we present RainNet, a deep convolutional neural network for radar-based precipitation nowcasting. Its design was inspired by the U-Net and SegNet families of deep learning models which were originally designed for binary segmentation tasks. RainNet was trained to predict continuous precipitation intensities at a lead time of ﬁve minutes, using several years of quality-controlled weather radar composites provided by the German Weather Service (DWD). That data 5 set covers Germany with a spatial domain of 900×900 km, and has a resolution of 1 km in space and 5 minutes in time. Independent veriﬁcation experiments were carried out on eleven summer precipitation events from 2016 to 2017. In order to achieve a lead time of one hour, a recursive approach was implemented by using RainNet predictions at ﬁve minutes lead time as model input for longer lead times. In the veriﬁcation experiments, trivial Eulerian persistence and a conventional model based on optical ﬂow served as benchmarks. The latter is available in the rainymotion library, and had previously been shown 10 to outperform DWD’s operational nowcasting model for the same set of veriﬁcation events.},

	abstract = {A ‘nowcast’ is a type of weather forecast which makes predictions in the very short term, typically less than two hours - a period in which traditional numerical weather prediction can be limited. This type of weather prediction has important applications for commercial aviation; public and outdoor events; and the construction industry, power utilities, and ground transportation services that conduct much of their work outdoors. Importantly, one of the key needs for nowcasting systems is in the provision of accurate warnings of adverse weather events, such as heavy rain and ﬂooding, for the protection of life and property in such situations. Typical nowcasting approaches are based on simple extrapolation models applied to observations, primarily rainfall radar. In this paper we review existing techniques to radar-based nowcasting from environmental sciences, as well as the statistical approaches that are applicable from the ﬁeld of machine learning. Nowcasting continues to be an important component of operational systems and we believe new advances are possible with new partnerships between the environmental science and machine learning communities.},

There is some evidence that better weather forecasts can be produced by introducing big data mining and neural networks into the weather prediction workflow. Here, we discuss the question of whether it is possible to completely replace the current numerical weather models and data assimilation systems with DL approaches. This discussion entails a review of state-of-the-art machine learning concepts and their applicability to weather data with its pertinent statistical properties. We think that it is not inconceivable that numerical weather models may one day become obsolete, but a number of fundamental breakthroughs are needed before this goal comes into reach.

	abstract = {An ensemble-based probabilistic precipitation forecasting scheme has been developed that blends an extrapolation nowcast with a downscaled NWP forecast, known as STEPS: Short-Term Ensemble Prediction System. The uncertainties in the motion and evolution of radar-inferred precipitation fields are quantified, and the uncertainty in the evolution of the precipitation pattern is shown to be the more important. The use of ensembles allows the scheme to be used for applications that require forecasts of the probability density function of areal and temporal averages of precipitation, such as fluvial flood forecasting—a capability that has not been provided by previous probabilistic precipitation nowcast schemes. The output from a NWP forecast model is downscaled so that the small scales not represented accurately by the model are injected into the forecast using stochastic noise. This allows the scheme to better represent the distribution of precipitation rate at spatial scales finer than those adequately resolved by operational NWP. The performance of the scheme has been assessed over the month of March 2003. Performance evaluation statistics show that the scheme possesses predictive skill at lead times in excess of six hours. © Crown copyright, 2006.},

	abstract = {Abstract Delivering reliable nowcasts (short-range forecasts) of severe rainfall and the resulting flash floods is important in densely populated urban areas. The conventional method is advection-based extrapolation of radar echoes. However, during rapidly evolving convective rainfall this so-called Lagrangian persistence (LP) approach is limited to deterministic and very short-range nowcasts. To address these limitations in the 1-h time range, a novel extension of LP, called Lagrangian Integro-Difference equation model with Autoregression (LINDA), is proposed. The model consists of five components: 1) identification of rain cells, 2) advection, 3) autoregressive process describing growth and decay of the cells, 4) convolution describing loss of predictability at small scales, and 5) stochastic perturbations to simulate forecast uncertainty. Advection is separated from the other components that are applied in the Lagrangian coordinates. The reliability of LINDA is evaluated using the NEXRAD WSR-88D radar that covers the Dallas–Fort Worth metropolitan area, as well as the NEXRAD mosaic covering the continental United States. This is done with two different configurations: LINDA-D for deterministic and LINDA-P for probabilistic nowcasts. The validation dataset consists of 11 rainfall events during 2018–20. For predicting moderate to heavy rainfall (5–20 mm h−1), LINDA outperforms the previously proposed LP-based approaches. The most significant improvement is seen for the ETS and POD statistics with the 5 mm h−1 threshold. For 30-min nowcasts, they show 15\% and 16\% increases, respectively, to the second-best method and 48\% and 34\% increases compared to LP. For the 5 mm h−1 threshold, the increase in the relative operating characteristic (ROC) skill score of 30-min nowcasts from the second-best method is 10\%. Significance Statement Delivering reliable forecasts of severe rainfall for the next few hours has a major societal importance. This is particularly true for densely populated urban areas, where flash floods can cause property damage and loss of lives. Such forecasts are conventionally produced by direct extrapolation of weather radar measurements. However, for intense localized rainfall this approach has low prediction ability beyond 30 min. To extend this limit, we propose a novel method that combines machine vision with a statistical model for growth and decay of rainfall. The method is designed for predicting highly localized rain cells and bands. In addition, a stochastic extension for producing probabilistic forecasts is developed. Using several verification metrics, we demonstrate that for predicting moderate to heavy rainfall (5–20 mm h−1), the proposed method has significantly improved forecast skill compared to the reference methods. The evaluation is done by using the NEXRAD WSR-88D that covers the Dallas–Fort Worth urban metroplex with a population of over 7 million. Demonstration of the applicability of LINDA in a larger domain is done by using the NEXRAD radar network that covers the continental United States.},

	abstract = {Precipitation nowcasting, the high-resolution forecasting of precipitation up to two hours ahead, supports the real-world socioeconomic needs of many sectors reliant on weather-dependent decision-making1,2. State-of-the-art operational nowcasting methods typically advect precipitation fields with radar-based wind estimates, and struggle to capture important non-linear events such as convective initiations3,4. Recently introduced deep learning methods use radar to directly predict future rain rates, free of physical constraints5,6. While they accurately predict low-intensity rainfall, their operational utility is limited because their lack of constraints produces blurry nowcasts at longer lead times, yielding poor performance on rarer medium-to-heavy rain events. Here we present a deep generative model for the probabilistic nowcasting of precipitation from radar that addresses these challenges. Using statistical, economic and cognitive measures, we show that our method provides improved forecast quality, forecast consistency and forecast value. Our model produces realistic and spatiotemporally consistent predictions over regions up to 1,536 km × 1,280 km and with lead times from 5–90 min ahead. Using a systematic evaluation by more than 50 expert meteorologists, we show that our generative model ranked first for its accuracy and usefulness in 89\% of cases against two competitive methods. When verified quantitatively, these nowcasts are skillful without resorting to blurring. We show that generative nowcasting can provide probabilistic predictions that improve forecast value and support operational utility, and at resolutions and lead times where alternative methods struggle.},

However, greater realism does not necessarily mean more accurate precipitation forecasts. The rapid growth of errors on small scales in conjunction with preexisting errors on larger scales may limit the usefulness of such models. The purpose of this paper is to examine whether improved model resolution alone is able to produce more skillful precipitation forecasts on useful scales, and how the skill varies with spatial scale. A verification method will be described in which skill is determined from a comparison of rainfall forecasts with radar using fractional coverage over different sized areas. The Met Office Unified Model was run with grid spacings of 12, 4, and 1 km for 10 days in which convection occurred during the summers of 2003 and 2004. All forecasts were run from 12-km initial states for a clean comparison. The results show that the 1-km model was the most skillful over all but the smallest scales (approximately {\textless}10–15 km). A measure of acceptable skill was defined; this was attained by the 1-km model at scales around 40–70 km, some 10–20 km less than that of the 12-km model. The biggest improvement occurred for heavier, more localized rain, despite it being more difficult to predict. The 4-km model did not improve much on the 12-km model because of the difficulties of representing convection at that resolution, which was accentuated by the spinup from 12-km fields.},
